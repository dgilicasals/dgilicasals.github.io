				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The landing is very close, Java 8 is going to be released in just 5 days (March 18).</p>
<p>This is very exciting as after many years of controversy, Java will eventually have lambda expressions as part of the language. No more need to use anonymous inner classes with a single method to implement callbacks!</p>
<p>You can find the official list of <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/features">all the new features on the OpenJdk site</a> but other than closures, I&#8217;m also very excited about some other enhancements such as the Streams API, the new Date &amp; Time API, and the removal of the Permgen space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to cover some of these new features in a more detailed manner by posting dedicated posts with some code examples. But in the meantime, and if you are interested, Oracle has a Java 8 Launch Webcast with some panel discussions about some of the new features and enhancements. You can register here: <a href="http://eventreg.oracle.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKWebId=0x637279c68" target="_blank">http://eventreg.oracle.com/<wbr />profile/web/index.cfm?PKWebId=<wbr />0x637279c68</a></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/programming-abstraction-liskov" title="The Power of Abstaction">Here is an amazing talk</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov" title="Barbara Liskov">Barbara Liskov</a> about how the idea of abstraction helped to address the complexity of large software projects and how it&#8217;s been gradually incorporated in modern languages. </p>
<p>Barbara is a Turing award winner and you might know her from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a> (LSP), the L in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID principles</a> in OOP.</p>
<p>Barbara describes the situation and the progress made in the 60s and 70s in Programming Methodology to improve how software should be designed and structured. You probably learned in college things such as the use of modularity, the importance of avoiding Go To statements and global variables, encapsulation, etc and you might think that these were just natural things that you could take for granted.</p>
<p>But it actually took some time to come up with these ideas and some of them even had to overcome some controversy at that time. So it&#8217;s very interesting to learn about the history and context of these programming languages concepts that are present today in the majority of modern OOP languages.</p>

We can expect a sneak peek of iOS 7 and OS X 10.9, which should be available later on this year as usual. And hopefully some new hardware, but this is more difficult to anticipate (other than usual processor refreshes as the new Intel Haswell).</p>
<p>My wish list includes also the long rumored SDK and App Store for the Apple TV. But I don&#8217;t count much on this.</p>
<p>On iOS 7, I&#8217;m really optimistic about seeing the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingXPCServices.html">interprocess communication (XPC) </a>ported to our mobile OS. This is something that Apple needs to address, Android has had <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html">Intents</a> for quite some time now.</p>
<p>And of course, I&#8217;m excited to see some of Jony Ive touch in a redesign of the look and feel and usability of iOS. Nothing major though, Apple is a strong believer in iteration rather than major revamps.</p>
<p>On this, it&#8217;s interesting to take a look at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wwdc/id640199958?mt=8">WWDC application</a> published by Apple this week. Its flat design might be an indication of what we are going to see. Design aside, the app gives you not only access to the session/events schedule  but also the videos of the previous WWDC sessions. And apparently, they should be posting this year sessions quite quickly too; hopefully this same week.</p>

Google presented a lot of new and improved services. A new<a href="play.google.com/music"> music service</a> <em>a la</em> Spotify, Hangouts as a cross-platform messaging system, an amazing revamp of Google Maps and many enhancements to Google+.</p>
<p>And last but not least, they also showed a lot of love for us. This year Google I/O was clearly a conference for developers, including the keynote. I&#8217;m particularly interested in the new Android Studio based on IntelliJ. I&#8217;ve been tempted to switch to this acclaimed IDE for quite some time, I think I&#8217;m going to have now the perfect excuse.</p>
<p>Back to the purpose of this post, Google has published all  Android Sessions on a YouTube playlist:  <a title="Android Sessions" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9WGUwq2gQ-coU3fSyexgOx">Google I/O 2013 &#8211; Android Sessions</a></p>

			</h2>
					</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>My first supervisor, which I consider a mentor, didn&#8217;t allow me to release a version of my code until I had zero warnings. At the time, I found it very tedious to go chase some of the warnings, specially when I knew the code was going to work fine. Come on, it was &#8216;just&#8217; a warning.</p>
<p>But this was a very wise piece of advise, so I just wanted to transmit it now myself.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll come back to the static vs dynamic language debate in the future, but if you go with a static language, you need to take advantage of the validations that are going to be made by the compiler.</p>
<p>A compiler can find a lot of potential problems/issues or stuff that you don&#8217;t really want to have in your code (e.g. unused variables, unreachable code, etc). Many compilers (and IDEs that include the compiler) might limit the number of warnings by default, so novice developers don&#8217;t get too scared. So it&#8217;s worth reviewing your level of warnings and increase it as much as you can.</p>
<p>Let me finish this post by adding a reference to the article that originated my post. It&#8217;s a must-read for anybody doing serious Objective-c development:<a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2013/04/compiler-warnings-for-objective-c-developers/"> Compiler Warnings for Objective-C Developers</a></p>
<p>And remember, in production code, a warning equals an error.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few months ago I posted about the competitiion between web and native app development and my feeling that contrary to what you would think (based on what desktop development ended up being), native app development could eventually win.</p>
<p>LinkedIn just released a major update of its mobile app and it seems to confirm the native apps trend. Ok, we are still far from being able to declare a winner but it&#8217;s significant that some of these big tech guys are moving to native.</p>
<p>VentureBeat.com has the reasons <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/">Why LinkedIn dumped HTML5 &amp; went native for its mobile apps</a>.</p>
<p>Some interesting stuff:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have definitely shifted from HTML5 to native. The primary reason for that is, we’re seeing that more and more people are spending more time in the app, and the app is running out of memory. It’s not performance issues, like speed or rendering, but it’s still a big problem.</em><br />
<em> The second reason we’ve gone native is trying to get some of the animations — the spinners and the way they work — getting that smoothness, we felt like we needed native to really do that well.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There are a few things that are critically missing. One is tooling support — having a debugger that actually works, performance tools that tell you where the memory is running out.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Big news this week, Google has decided to shut down one of these services that blew all the competitors away: Google Reader. Google stated two main reasons: the number of users is decreasing year after year and they want to focus on other products.</p>
<p>My take from what we&#8217;ve been seeing recently at Google is that the second reason weighed much more than the first one. I have no idea what the numbers are but from the blogosphere reaction, it&#8217;s clear that a lot of people are still using this service (me included).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen different reactions to this news, from <a title="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">Om Malik</a> announcing that he&#8217;s not going to trust Google on any of its new products anymore to <a title="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich" href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich">Marco Arment</a> who, as a service owner himself (Instapaper) recognizes that it&#8217;s to the company to decide if they want to continue a service or not and any service has a limited lifespan anyway.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the end of all these Google services opens up also a different debate. According to Google, many of these services originated from the 20% of time that the Googlers can dedicate to their own projects. It looks like since Larry Page took over, Google has been trying to kill all the services to refocus only on the products that are strategic to the company (Android, Google+ and of course Search and advertisements).</p>
<p>So you could think that this is going to kill the creativity of Google and could even provoke a departure of talent in the company. You know, engineers tend to be more motivated and involved when they work for something they created and designed themselves. That&#8217;s what I thought too.</p>
<p>And then, this week I watched the 60 Minutes show about Jack Dorsey, one of the Twitter founders,  and I noted something very interesting. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>(&#8230;) constraints actually help creativity, because instead of having a big blank slate that might intimidate you, having constraints make you focus.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this makes a lot of sense, and it&#8217;s definitely proven right with Twitter (hashtags, RT, FF, etc).</p>
<p>So hopefully, the end of all these products at Google will bring a lot of innovation and bright ideas into their core services.</p>
<p>Watch the <a title="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50143028n" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50143028n">60 Minutes overtime video</a> on why you can only have 140 characters per tweet.</p>
<p>The full <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50143017n">60 Minutes about Jack Dorsey</a> is totally worth it&#8230;</p>
